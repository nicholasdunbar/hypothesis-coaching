He asked if I would mentor him to become an entrepreneur. It quickly became more about life than entrepreneurship. Today he is a grown man who repeatedly tells me I am one of the most influential people in his life and he encourages me to help other young men sort their lives out the way I helped him. He is my inspiration for my life-direction coaching program.",

Knowing what changes to make isn’t enough, you need to know how to make the changes. A health coach, like me, who has been through the process can help you make the changes to your diet.",
      "p":"Don’t be alarmed, in most cases it can take years or decades to start having problems, but if NAFLD isn’t handled early on, it can turn into painful liver scarring (cirrhosis), which later on can become fatal. If you have a lifestyle that gave you NAFLD then you probably have a lifestyle that increases your risk of getting diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or a stroke.",
