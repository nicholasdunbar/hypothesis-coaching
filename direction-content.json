      "p":"In the late-teens and early-twenties it is normal for young adults to be unsure of what to do with their lives. It’s a big decision. They are growing up and that means they are listening to you less. That's a good thing, but it makes it hard to support them. That’s where coaching from someone neutral and outside the family can be useful.",

      "p":"Your child sets the goals, and the coach uses a variety of psychological techniques to stimulate their motivation. One such technique we use is Motivational Interviewing (MI) which has been proven effective in 200 randomized controlled trials. The world's top performers, such as professional athletes, CEOs, and artists use it. Why not your son or daughter?",

      "p":"A coach is not an authority figure or an expert in occupations. He is an equal partner that facilitates thinking. He helps your son or daughter overcome the mental blocks preventing action.  Life-direction is beyond career or education, it's about discovering what kind of life they want to live and what kind of adult they want to become."
