      "d":"Years ago I was diagnosed with NAFLD. I was told that reversing it was rare. I was determined to beat the odds and I eventually succeeded. Knowing what changes to make isn’t enough, you need to know how to make the changes. A health coach, like me, who has been through the process can help you make the changes to your diet.",
      "p":"Don’t be alarmed, in most cases it can take years or decades to start having problems, but if NAFLD isn’t handled early on, it can turn into painful liver scarring (cirrhosis), which later on can become fatal. If you have a lifestyle that gave you NAFLD then you probably have a lifestyle that increases your risk of getting diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or a stroke.",

      "p":"You set the goals, and the coach uses a variety of psychological techniques to stimulate your motivation. One such technique we will use is Motivational Interviewing (MI) which has been proven effective in 200 randomized controlled trials. The world's top performers, such as professional athletes, CEOs, and artists use it. Why not you?",

Coaching for NAFLD requires an integrated approach with a register dietitian, functional medical doctor, gastroenterologist, other qualified MD."
